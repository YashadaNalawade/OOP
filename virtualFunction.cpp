// A virtual function (also known as virtual methods) is a member function that is declared within a base 
// class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a 
// pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the 
// derived classâ€™s version of the method.
// Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of 
// reference (or pointer) used for the function call. They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
	virtual void print() { cout << "print base class\n"; }

	void show() { cout << "show base class\n"; }
};

class derived : public base {
public:
	void print() { cout << "print derived class\n"; }

	void show() { cout << "show derived class\n"; }
};

int main()
{
	base* bptr;
	derived d;
	bptr = &d;

	// Virtual function, binded at runtime
	bptr->print();

	// Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
